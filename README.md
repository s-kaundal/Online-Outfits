## On-the-phone Outfits

**On-the-phone Outfits** is an app to keep your wardrobe portable and easy-to-maintain, all at the tip of your fingers. 
From *fashion fanatics* to *simple dressers*, anyone who wants to use this app can:
- keep track of their clothes
- budget for their closet
- make outfits for the next day 
- see all of their clothes displayed easily
- sort clothes based on categories

I've always wanted an app that would make it easier for me to coordinate outfits and visualize my closet, so here it is!

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to add a top/bottom/pair of shoes/accessory to my collection of tops/bottoms/shoes
- As a user, I want to describe each clothing with price, store bought from, and a category
- As a user, I want to see all clothing categorized as a certain style
- As a user, I want to select all the tops/bottoms/shoes/accessories in my wardrobe, list them all, and view them all
- As a user, I want to select a top with a bottom with a pair of shoes and some accessories and view them together
- As a user, I want to save my outfits I made and viewed to my collection
- As a user, I want to save my outfit creations to file and be warned to save before quiting
- As a user, I want to load my outfits from file or work from where I left off (given the option)

Phase 4: Task 3
- I would add Exception classes for illegal adding removing or changing of data of clothing, outfit, listOfClothing, 
or outfitList and for images opening
- I would refactor and make abstract and interface classes to decrease the duplication
- I would think more about bi-directionality and where it would be helpful for my data
